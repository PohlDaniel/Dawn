# Dawn

This repository contains a new setup of https://github.com/iamCode/Dawn.
I added the needed SDL, Freetype, LUA and zLib dependencies and also wrote a small description on how to build it on windows.
By my own I used Visual Studio 2015.

It should be clear that the Copyright of Dawn and of all dependencies not in my hand.

My intention for this repository is to get a deeper understanding of game programing.

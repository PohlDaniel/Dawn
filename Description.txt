freetype 2.4.4	https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.4.4/
	-> use solution out of builds/win32/vc2008
	-> build freetype as static library
	-> use Multi-threaded DLL (/MD) insteed of Multi-threaded (/MT)
	-> rename the library to freetype.lib
	-> use include as it is
	
SDL  1.2	https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL-1.2/tree/release-1.2.15
	-> use solution of VisualC
	-> get SDL_config.h out of https://libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-VC.zip and copy it to SDL/include
	-> build SDL and SDLmain
				
				
SDL_mixer 1.2	https://libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL_mixer-1.2.12.zip
	-> use solution of VisualC
	-> copy the files out of SDL/include to SDL_mixer/VisualC/eternal/inlcude
	-> copy the built SDL.lib to SDL_mixer/VisualC/eternal/lib/x86
	-> add the external/include folder to the projects "native_midi" and "timidity"
	-> add the library path SDL_mixer/VisualC/eternal/lib/x86 to the project "SDL_mixer"
	-> build SDL_mixer

SDL_image 1.2	https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/SDL_image-1.2.12.zip
	-> use solution of VisualC
	-> copy the files out of SDL/include to SDL_image/VisualC/eternal/inlcude
	-> copy the built SDL.lib to SDL_image/VisualC/eternal/lib/x86
	-> add the library path SDL_mixer/VisualC/eternal/lib/x86 to the project "SDL_image"
	-> build SDL_image

zlib 1.2.11		https://zlib.net/
	-> create solution with cmake
	-> build zlib
	-> use zlib.lib and zlib.dll
	-> use zconf.h and zlib.h for including in other project's

lua	5.1.5	https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.5.tar.gz	
	-> follow this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALXtup2CjI to build the lua.lib and lua.dll
	-> use all the files out of lua/include
	-> use lua.hpp out of etc

toluapp(tolua++) https://github.com/LuaDist/toluapp
	-> generate the solution with cmake, use lua.lib, lua/include and lua.exe from lua 5.1.5 during the process
	-> build toluapp_lib as static library
	-> use Mult-threaded DLL (/MD)
	-> change the Target Extension to .lib
	-> use tolua++.h out of include

Dawn 	https://github.com/iamCode/Dawn		
	-> copy freetype, lua, SDL, zlib includes to Dawn include
	-> copy SDL.lib, SDLmain.lib, SDL_image.lib, SDL_mixer.lib, freetype.lib, zlib.lib, lua.lib, toluapp.lib to Dawn/lib	
	-> important: I used local variant's of GL.h and GLU.h during debuging and so I had to change GLee.h (line 58) and SDL_opengl.h (line 46, 47)
	-> copy libogg-0.dll, libpng15-15.dll, libvorbis-0.dll, libvorbisfile-3.dll, lua.dll, SDL.dll, SDL_image.dll, SDL_mixer.dll, zlib.dll, zlib1.dll to Dawn
	-> build the porject Dawn out of the Dawn.sln use "Release" and "x86"
	
Generate luainterface
	-> build toluapp out of toluapp.sln
	-> open cmd change to the directory Dawn/scripts and execute "toluapp.exe -o luainterfacegenerated.cpp -H luainterfacegenerated.h luainterface.pkg"
	-> the built lua.dll from lua 5.1.5 is neccessary
